[2022-01-03 12:00:13.122] [jointLog] [info] Computed 36,125 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2022-01-03 12:00:13.122] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1,602,752 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-01-03 12:00:13.234] [jointLog] [warning] 0.060137% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 21.

[2022-01-03 12:00:13.258] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1602752 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
