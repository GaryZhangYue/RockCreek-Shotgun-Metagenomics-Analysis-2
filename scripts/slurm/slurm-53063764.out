[2021-12-30 16:45:34.338] [jointLog] [info] Computed 138 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2021-12-30 16:45:34.338] [jointLog] [info] Counted 9,670 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2021-12-30 16:45:34.353] [jointLog] [warning] 0.060137% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 21.

[2021-12-30 16:45:34.353] [jointLog] [warning] Only 9670 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
